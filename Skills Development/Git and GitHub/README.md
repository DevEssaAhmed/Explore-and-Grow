## <div align="center"> Overview of Git and GitHub</div>

Git is a version control system that is widely used in software development to manage source code and track changes over time. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools.

- ### Git

    Git is a distributed version control system that was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git allows developers to track changes to their code over time, collaborate with others, and manage multiple versions of their code. Git uses a branching model that allows developers to work on multiple versions of their code simultaneously and to merge changes between branches. Git is widely used in software development and is supported by many integrated development environments (IDEs) and text editors.

- ### GitHub

    GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and additional features such as issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools. GitHub allows developers to share their code with others, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open source software. GitHub provides a social platform for developers to connect with others, showcase their work, and build a portfolio of their projects.
